    I'm a loud mouthed lover of cats and data. I think code should be free, scalable, and beautiful. I'm in love with new technology and exploring the best option for a project rather than whatever will work. I prefer the terminal over GUI and javascript is my language of choice. I love to dance and make others smile.
    <br><br>
    I'm currently working towards becoming a software engineer specializing in data visualization.
    <br><br>
    Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ. I've been a member of HeatSync Labs, a hackerspace in Mesa, AZ, since 2012. In the summer of 2013, I was accepted to Hacker School and spent 3 months in New York becoming a better programmer.
    <br><br>
    When I'm not programming, I enjoy video games, music, hiking, rock climbing, and dancing.
