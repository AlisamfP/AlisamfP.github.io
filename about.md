    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I'm a loud mouthed lover of cats and data.</p>

    <p>I think code should be free, scalable, and beautiful. Intellectually curious and self-driven, I and strive to learn as much as possible everyday. Data is wonderful. Everything is better with data, and data is better when it's beautiful.</p>

    <p>I'm currently working at Octoblu as a software engineer.</p>
    
    <p>Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ. I've helped run HeatSync Labs, a hackerspace in Mesa, AZ, since 2012. I help maintain the space, hold open hours, host different events bringing tech into the community(Coffee&Code, HackPHX), and teach classes on different topics(soldering, piano, DNS, musical theory, 3D printing). In the summer of 2013, I was accepted to Recurse Center and spent 3 months in New York becoming a better programmer.

    <p>
    Video games are a second passion of mine. I was a professional video game player for years, and helped tutor autistic kids using video games. I believe that video games can be used to enhance the learning process, and help with multiple other aspects as well.
    I love to dance and make others smile.
