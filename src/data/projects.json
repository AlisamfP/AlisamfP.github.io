            "background": "React Rally is a two-day developer conference held in Park City, Utah, centered around the React ecosystem. It places a strong emphasis on community, inclusivity, and creating a friendly atmosphere. The event features engaging talks from both first-time and experienced speakers, and encourages meaningful connections between attendees.",
            "problem": "The conference needed printed and digital collateral that reflected its friendly, community-driven tone while remaining clear, professional, and easy for attendees to navigate. The challenge was to balance personality with practicality across a variety of formats.",
            "process": "I started by gathering all the information needed and determining the color scheme of the project. After that I began sketching out layouts for the booklet, badge, and table tent sign. Then I started working in Adobe InDesign to lay out the event program booklet. After the booklet was done, I began working on the badge and table tent. Finally, I made the web ad for next yearâ€™s event.",
            "results": "Although this was a speculative project, it successfully met my goal of designing a complete and cohesive visual system for an event. It gave me the chance to practice organizing large amounts of content into a clear, readable, and visually engaging layout. I completed it on time, got positive feedback from peers, and was proud of how it strengthened my skills in layout and brand consistency.",
