      | Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, I graduated from Greenway High School in 2009 and went to Scottsdale Community College to pursue a degree in Mathematics. Growing up I competed in Guitar Hero and DDR tournaments, which led to my working at GameStop until early 2014. I started programming in the winter of 2012, competed in a few hackathons, and returned to school changing my major from Math to Computer Science.

      | In the summer of 2013, I was accepted to Hacker School and spent 3 months in New York becoming a better programmer. Since then, I've been working diligently on that same goal, becoming a better programmer.
