####What is a database?
A database is an organized collection of data. They are usually organized in such a way that makes it easy to naviagte the data. You usually interact with them using DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle. If you want to know more, you should probably [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Database).

---

####DBMS?
DBMS stands for database management system. Database management systems help...manage databases? Specifically they're programs designed to help users interact with databases and the data stored within them. They usually contain the ability to do some CRUD operations.

---

####CRUD?
The four operations every DBMS has to allow the user to manipulate the data.

1. Create
2. Read
3. Update
4. Delete


---

####What is a RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for a relational database management system. A relational database is a database in which the data and how it's related is stored.

---

####SQL
Structured Query Language. A language designed to navigate RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems).

---

####NoSQL vs SQL
This debate is really centered around the concept that relational databases are not always the most efficient choice for data storage. [The best explaination.](http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)

---

####NoSQL Database Types

1. Document Based
2. Key-Value Pairs
3. Graph Stores
4. Wide Column Stores

---

####Mongo DB
[Mongo DB](http://www.mongodb.org/about/introduction/) is an open source, document based, NoSQL database.

####What's Mongod?

Mongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system. It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs background management operations. It runs in the background, and is what mongo needs to connect to.

####What's a daemon?

In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

###Mongo Basics

Start up an instance on mongo. If you followed the download tutorial, you should have a mongod service already running

*mongod defaults to running on port 27017 and dbpath*
```
 /data/db 
```

```
 ~$ mongo 
```

To see all of your databases run 
```
 > show dbs 
``` 

To switch to working with a database, run 'use dbName'. 
When booting up mongo, you have to specify which database you want to work in either by setting it when you run mongo or running use once mongo has started.

Mongo will also create the database if you try to use one that isn't yet made.

```
> use test
```

And to show which database you're currently working in...

```
> db
```


From within the mongo shell, you can do any of the 4 CRUD operations.

####Create
Within each database, you can have collections (groupings of documents). They're the equivalent to tables in RDBMS.
Let's start by creating a collection and inserting documents into it.

```
> me = { name: "Alisa", age: 23, dob: 09/06/1991 }
```

Then, insert the data into the collection by using 
```
db.collectionName.insert(dataToInsert)
```

*Just like with databases, Mongo will create the collection when you insert data into it if it doesn't exist yet*

So, to create the collection and insert your object.
```
> db.testData.insert(me)
```

Check that the collection was created
```
> show collections
```
