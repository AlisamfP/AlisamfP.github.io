Hi there! Alisa here! 



About:

I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. During my youth I was a gymnast and math tutor. During high school I was heavily involved in the theatre troupe as head of the make-up department for 3 years. I was chosen to teach special fx and gore makeup to over 500 students at Washington High School for their haunted house. After graduating high school, I volunteered in the Rocky Horror Picture Show for a few years, performing as Janet, Columbia, Frank, and Trixie. In the past 2 years
